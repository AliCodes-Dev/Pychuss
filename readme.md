## 🧠 About the Project

**PyChuss** is not just another beginner Python project. It’s a structured, object-oriented chess game built from the ground up using **Pygame**. It features real piece movement rules, a working board, capturing logic, and a dev-friendly architecture.

Perfect if you’re learning:
- Game architecture design (OOP)
- Turn-based logic
- Rule validation
- Modular Python development

---

## 🧱 Features

✅ Clean OOP design with modular components  
✅ Mouse-based gameplay — click to move  
✅ Accurate chess piece movement (all 6 types)  
✅ Legal captures with real board state updates  
✅ Turn-based system: White vs Black  
✅ Git-tracked public repo — dev-friendly

---

## 🏗️ What’s Cooking (To-Do)

- ♚ Check / Checkmate Detection  
- ✨ Visual move highlighting  
- 🤝 Stalemate / Draw rules  
- 🧵 GUI polish (restart menu, win screen, etc.)
